# Preliminaries

- This file should be in `STAT240/hw/hw02` on your local computer. If you want the barplot from problem 2to render in the knitted file, download `exampleBarplot.png` to that folder as well.
- You should also download `lake-monona-winters-2024.csv` and `lake-mendota-winters-2024.csv` to `STAT240/data` on your local computer.

While you should create your answers in the .Rmd file, homework problems are better formatted and therefore easier to read in the .html file. We recommended frequently knitting and switching between the two as you read and solve problems.

```{r read-data, echo = FALSE}
monona = read_csv("../../data/lake-monona-winters-2024.csv") %>% 
  mutate(ff_cat = case_match(
    ff_cat,
    "X" ~ "Jan 1-15",
    .default = ff_cat
  ), 
  ff_cat = reorder(ff_cat, ff_x))
```

# Problem 1

**Create a histogram** of the `duration` of Lake Monona's closures due to ice. (That is, using the `monona` dataframe created above.)

Incorporate the following customizations:

- **Bars should span neat intervals of ten**; [40, 50], [50, 60], and so on. Make sure they start and end on multiples of 10.

- **Change the outline and inside color** of the bars to some custom combination that you think looks good together.

```{r}
# 
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(monona, aes(x = duration)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, boundary = 40, fill = "steelblue", color = "darkred") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(40, max(monona$duration, na.rm = TRUE), by = 10)) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Lake Monona Closures Due to Ice",
       x = "Duration (days)",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

```

# Problem 2

Your friend is trying to produce this plot of frequency counts for the variable `ff_cat`, which captures the date of first freeze in two week periods.

![*Check the knitted .html file or the exampleBarplot.png file itself. For the image to render in your knitted file, download exampleBarplot.png next to this .Rmd.*](exampleBarplot.png)

Your friend's attempt below is producing an error.

```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(monona, aes(x = ff_cat)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Frequency of First Freeze Categories",
       x = "First Freeze Category",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

```

**Fix** your friend's error by editing the above chunk (or create another one).

Then, below, **explain** why the original code was wrong and why the fixed code works.

> The original code is wrong because geom_col() expects you to provide both x and y values. It draws bars based on these two values. In the original code, only the x value (ff_cat) was provided, but there was no y value (like the counts of how many times each category appears).
The fixed code works because geom_bar() automatically counts how many times each category appears in ff_cat. You don't need to provide the y values yourself; geom_bar() calculates them for you and creates the bars based on these counts.



# Problem 3

Code in the next chunk makes a scatter plot that shows how the variable `duration` changes with time (using `year1`).

```{r}
# This chunk is provided for you - do not edit
ggplot(monona, aes(x = year1, y = duration)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Lake Monona Winter Closure Durations Over Time",
    subtitle = "Trend Line Shown in Blue"
  )
```

**a)** What does the argument `method = "lm"` change on the plot?

> The argument method = "lm" in the geom_smooth() function adds a linear regression line to the plot. This means it fits a straight line through the data points, showing the overall trend in how the variable duration changes over time (with year1).

**b)** What does the argument `se = FALSE` change on the plot?

> The argument se = FALSE removes the shaded confidence interval around the trend line. By default, geom_smooth() includes a shaded area showing uncertainty in the trend (the standard error), but setting se = FALSE turns that off, leaving just the line.

# Problem 4

This problem refers to the graph created in problem 3 above. Its goal is to display to the viewer that, on average, the duration Lake Monona closes due to ice is decreasing over time.

**a)** In a typical year around 1875, how long would Lake Monona close due to ice? (No code needed - your best guess based on the plot will suffice.) 

> Based on the plot, it appears that in a typical year around 1875, Lake Monona would close due to ice for about 120 to 130 days. This estimate comes from observing where the data points and the trend line lie on the y-axis near the year 1875.

**b)** In a typical year around 2000, how long would Lake Monona close due to ice?

> In a typical year around 2000, the plot suggests that Lake Monona would close due to ice for about 80 to 90 days. This estimate is based on the position of the data points and the trend line on the y-axis near the year 2000.

**c)** Consider encountering this graph in a published news paper. Name one specific thing this graph does well to accomplish its goal, and what specific part of the code is responsible for it.

> One specific thing this graph does well is that it effectively highlights the decreasing trend in the duration of Lake Mononaâ€™s ice closures over time. This helps communicate the main message of the graph. The part of the code responsible for this is:
geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
This adds a clear linear trend line to the scatter plot, making it easy to see how the closure duration has decreased over time.


**d)** In the same context as c), name one specific thing that could be improved about this graph, and describe what code you would add/edit to make it happen. (No need to formally write and run the code, just a description.)

> One thing that could be improved is the visibility of the data points. Right now, the points are a little too faint because alpha = 0.2 makes them very transparent. To fix this, you could increase the transparency value to make the points easier to see, like changing alpha to 0.5.
So, the change would be:
geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
This would make the points stand out more, making the graph clearer.



# Problem 5

The below chunk (which is hidden in the knitted file) reads in `lake-mendota-winters-2024.csv` into a new object called `mendota`.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
mendota = read_csv("../../data/lake-mendota-winters-2024.csv")
```

**Create** a single plot of `duration` versus `year1` (as in problem 3) which has **two smooth curved lines**; a red line for Lake Mendota and a blue line for Lake Monona.

You should accomplish this with one call to `ggplot()` and then two calls to `geom_smooth()`, with one using the `monona` data and one using the `mendota` data.

```{r}
# 
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
monona = read_csv("../../data/lake-monona-winters-2024.csv")
ggplot() +
  geom_smooth(data = monona, aes(x = year1, y = duration), method = "loess", color = "blue", se = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(data = mendota, aes(x = year1, y = duration), method = "loess", color = "red", se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Winter Closure Durations for Lake Monona and Lake Mendota",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Duration (days)",
    subtitle = "Blue: Lake Monona, Red: Lake Mendota"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

# Problem 6

The below chunk creates a new dataframe called `combined`, which contains freeze durations for both Lake Mendota AND Lake Monona.

```{r}
# We will learn how this code works next week!
combined = bind_rows(monona %>% mutate(lake = "Monona"), mendota %>% mutate(lake = "Mendota")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year1)) %>% 
  select(lake, year1, duration)

# Take a look at the first six rows; notice we have TWO rows for each year now, one for each lake!
head(combined)
```

**Create** a similar plot to the result of problem 5, with `duration` on the y axis, `year1` on the x axis, and two smooth lines, one for each lake. This time, use the `combined` dataset and a single call to `geom_smooth`.

*Hint: You want to `color` the lines by `lake`!*

```{r}
# 
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

combined <- bind_rows(monona %>% mutate(lake = "Monona"), mendota %>% mutate(lake = "Mendota")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year1)) %>% 
  select(lake, year1, duration)

head(combined)

ggplot(combined, aes(x = year1, y = duration, color = lake)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Winter Closure Durations for Lake Monona and Lake Mendota",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Duration (days)",
    subtitle = "Smooth Lines for Both Lakes"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

# Problem 7

**Create** a plot which uses **faceting** to separate the trendline of `duration` vs. `year1` (like the previous two questions) into two different panels; one panel for Lake Mendota, one panel for Lake Monona.

```{r}
# 
ggplot(combined, aes(x = year1, y = duration)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Winter Closure Durations for Lake Monona and Lake Mendota",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Duration (days)"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~lake) +  # Facet by the 'lake' column to create separate panels
  theme_minimal()

```

# Problem 8

Compare the resulting graphs from problems 5, 6, and 7.

Consider trying to determine in what time period Lake Mendota was freezing, on average, longer than Lake Monona.

**Which of the three graphs** do you prefer for this determination and why?

> Problem 5 (Two smooth lines on a single plot): This graph displays both lakes' trends on the same axes, making it easy to directly compare their durations over time. However, overlapping lines can make it harder to distinguish details in certain areas.
Problem 6 (Two smooth lines with color distinction): Like Problem 5, this graph shows both lakes on the same plot, but it uses different colors for each lake, which makes it easier to follow each trend. It's a good option for quickly identifying which lake had longer ice durations at different points in time.
Problem 7 (Faceted panels): This graph separates the two lakes into different panels. While it shows the individual trends more clearly, it's harder to directly compare the lakes side by side because they are in separate plots.
The graph from Problem 6 is the best choice for determining when Lake Mendota was freezing longer than Lake Monona, becuase
Both lakes are shown on the same axes, so you can directly see when one lake's line is above the other, making it easy to spot periods when Lake Mendota had longer durations. Also, The use of different colors for each lake allows for clear identification of each trend without the lines getting too confusing or overlapping.
